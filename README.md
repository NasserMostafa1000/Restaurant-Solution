⚠️ Important Notice
This application has not been sold or commercially distributed yet. It represents one of my early projects in software development.

There is a known design flaw in the database schema: the invoice structure (which contains multiple products per order) is handled via two separate tables, rather than a more optimized single-table relational design. This adds unnecessary complexity.

👉 In future updates, I plan to refactor the database for better maintainability and performance.
